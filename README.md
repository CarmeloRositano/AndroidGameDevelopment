### Game Concept:
Sidescroller where player slowly loses energy/ health when spawned. Defeating a field enemy will regenerate resource/ absorb it from enemy allowing the player to further progress. Map is infinite and gets more difficult as player survives. If player loses all health/ energy they die/ fail. Player is scored based on how long they've survived and how many enemies they kill. Different levels may include transitions during gameplay and modes could start off at a higher difficulty level.
Player has sword and shuriken attacks, and has dashing/ jumping abilities that drain his energy/ health.

### Typical Play Session:
Player spawns in and needs to run right and slay enemies to keep enough energy/ health to survive. Player will have to navigate various obstacles to progress or reach energy sources/ enemies. Players goal is to survive as long as possible to gain a high score and reacher the harder difficult areas, and the score will be recorded if its a new best.

### How Concept is Viable to Complete in a Semester:
The concept will be made using premade sprites to speed up production time, including players, enemies, levels and other assets. Most of the implementation will be working with collisions, movement and level designing, which is viable between the group members.
